## 🚀 Features
- Takes **student name** as input  
- Accepts marks in **Maths, Physics, Chemistry**  
- Calculates the **average marks**  
- Displays the **grade** based on performance

## 📂 Project Structure
grade_system_new.py # Main Python program

## 📝 How It Works
1. User enters the **student name**  
2. Program asks for marks in **Maths, Physics, Chemistry**  
3. Program calculates the **average**  
   ```python
   avg = (mar1 + mar2 + mar3) / 3

## 📊 Grade Calculation Rules

Based on the average, a grade is displayed:

- **90 and above** → Grade A  
- **70–89** → Grade B  
- **60–69** → Grade C  
- **Below 60** → Grade D

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Accept marks for more subjects dynamically  
- Store student records in a file (CSV/JSON)  
- Add GUI using Tkinter or a web version using Flask/Django
